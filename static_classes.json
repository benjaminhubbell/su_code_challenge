I received my Ph.D. from MIT's Sloan School of Management (2003) and a M.A. in social psychology and social anthropology from University of Aarhus and University of Copenhagen, Denmark. During my MA studies I spent two years as a Fulbright scholar at UC Berkeley, Department of Social and Cultural Studies. Subsequently, I worked in the Work Practice and Technology Group at Xerox PARC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My larger areas of interest include distributed &amp;amp; virtual work, organizational learning and knowledge, communication practices, and medical informatics. My research explores the organizational implications of information systems. More specifically, I study the organization, creation, and use of documents in distributed work environments where peoples daily practices are characterized by high mobility. Empirically, I approach these issues through in-depth qualitative and quantitative studies of everyday work practices in organizations including among others: Healtcare, eScience, free/libre/open source software development, game design, sales, citizen science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As modern organizations have become more global and distributed, organizational life is increasingly dependent on those who are distant in time and space. How to incorporate the concerns and contributions of absent others is an important consideration for organizational members. The organization, creation, and use of information systems serve as one strategy to capture and stand for the interests and work of others. My current research focuses on the practices that go into documenting work - which I refer to as documenting practices. This includes the activity of capturing knowledge in any media whether paper based, electronic or wall mounted. Studies of tangible documenting practices allow me to articulate the temporal and spatial dimensions of distributed and mobile work in organizational settings. In short, my research explores the question: how do people use documents to manage their movements and interactions in time and space?&lt;/p&gt;"

In 2013, he began his graduate career at Syracuse University&rsquo;s School of Information Studies. In May 2015, he graduated with a Master&rsquo;s of Science in Library and Information Science as well as a Certificate of Advanced Study in Data Science. Chad is the 2015 recipient of the Master&rsquo;s Prize in Library &amp; Information Science Award for Scholarship and Research.</span></span></p><p><span><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:'Cambria',serif;\">During his time at Syracuse, Chad worked as Graduate Research Assistant for the Veterans Career Transition Program, a program designed to provide IT and Project Management certification training to post-9/11 US military personnel who have transitioned or were transitioning from military to civilian life. He was responsible for administering the learning management system, working with Syracuse University iSchool faculty to design and deploy coursework, and building key indicators of performance.</span></span></p><p><span><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:'Cambria',serif;\">While working toward a graduate degree, Chad founded two companies. The first, HarperAMH, LLC, is a technology and business advisory firm with clients in industries ranging from public schools to medical device manufacturers. It is under this banner that he is also continuing his research, currently exploring the efficacy of social media participation in professional conversations and identifying the network sensitivities therein.</span></span></p><p><span><span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%;font-family:'Cambria',serif;\">Chad is also co-founder of Lithic Digitization and Archive Services, providing a full range of digitization, archive, and project management services to organizations such as libraries, archives, museums, and other organizations in the public and private sectors. Chad&rsquo;s IT and project management background, coupled with his experiences gained while earning his MSLIS, have positioned Lithic to fill an apparent void in the technical space in digital archive projects. As part of Lithic, the Emerging Nations Preservation project is a budding initiative to provide services to governments in emerging nations to develop an online presence for their historical treasures. It is through digitization initiatives that technology can be brought to places where it might otherwise not thrive, and provide an opportunity for the peoples of emerging nations to learn about technology in a way that connects them to the local and global communities.</span></span></p>"
